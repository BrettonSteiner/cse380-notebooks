Or in other words, they form an **independent set** of nodes --- nodes that are all independent of each other.)

From there, I can compare the length of the resulting intersection with the desired check. An anti-clique would have an intersection of 0 links and a clique would have an intersection of $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ links where $n$ is the number of nodes in the complete graph. I learned that the cartesian product is the way that I can calculate every possible link for a complete graph given the list of nodes. It even creates links that can't exist in my graph, such as (1,1). Therefore, I know that my solution has limitations which I will outline in the \"Meaningful\" section below."

I did this by using the fact that a complete graph will have a specific amount of edges between its nodes based on the number of nodes within it. So, instead of checking if any of the links exist, I take the count of links of the intersection of all possible edges that could exist in a complete graph (plus a few since the cartesian product of the nodes have some links in which one node connects back to itself) and I compare it with either the max number of links in said complete graph or zero, depending on if we are checking for a clique or anti-clique. As a result, I have a solution that only works given a few assumptions are true: the graph must not contain any duplicate edges, such as (1,2) and (2,1), and the graph must not contain any edges which point to the same node such as (1,1). If those conditions are met, then my solution will work.\n",

Unfortunately, we couldn't figure out how to use a dictionary representation with our check_clique_or_anti_clique function, so we didn't end up using it. Hannah didn't contribute very much to this assignment and was mostly quiet during our conversations. She didn't take any time outside of our meetings to do work on her own. I made the check_clique_or_anti_clique function which fit all the criteria we were aiming for.
