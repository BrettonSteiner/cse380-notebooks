        "At first, I thought the pigeon principle was going to be a difficult thing to understand, but it is totally the opposite! I was easily able to follow Brother Bessey as he described it and presented examples. It is surprising how things of seemly little significance can actually hold proof of truths that we search for.\n",
        "\n",
        "The one thing that stood out to me the most was actually the exercise on page 40. After I solved it, I realized that it didn't matter what exactly the true and false statements were for each individual. I could swap any of them out for a different true or false statement and the results would be exactly the same because when it comes down to calculating the pigeonholes, both ways will just be multiplying the total count by 2 due to their binary nature. I wonder if this can be used to find the existance special truths that we don't think about in the first place. I can't find any specific examples through my own thoughts, but I am sure this is important in some way. After all, what may seem like an unimportant coincidence could actually be a gateway to truth.\n",

        "When I first read about the certainty-not-chance feature of the pigeonhole principle I had to pause and think it through. There wasn't a lot of evidence to support this claim in the article other than just stating that it is a thing. But I was able to understand it as I thought it through. It is a pretty cool truth that I didn't realize before.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unfortunately, the pigeonhole principle only proves that a solution exists which leads me to the philosophical aspect of the pigeonhole principle. Even though I may not think this very important, it actually has huge rammifications in mathematics. Some problems are hopelessly complex and the idea of finding a solution may seem nearly impossible. Some may think there is no solution at all. With this principle, the existance of a solution can be proven, even though the solution itself hasn't been found.\n",
        "\n",
        "I discussed these ideas with my mom. She didn't seem surprised by the pigeon principle and seemed to understand it pretty easily. That may be due to the fact that I used examples similar to Brother Bessey's in his article. She didn't seem to see the significance of being able to prove that a solution exists for a problem, but I suppose that is okay since she isn't a mathematician."
