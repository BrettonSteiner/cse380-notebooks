        "At first, I thought the pigeon principle was going to be a difficult thing to understand, but it is the opposite! I was easily able to follow Brother Bessey as he described it and presented examples. It is surprising how things of seemly little significance can hold proof of truths that we search for.\n",

        "The one thing that stood out to me the most was the exercise on page 40. After I solved it, I realized that it didn't matter what exactly the true and false statements were for each individual. I could swap any of them out for a different true or false statement and the results would be the same because when it comes down to calculating the pigeonholes, both ways will just be multiplying the total count by 2 due to their binary nature. I wonder if this can be used to find the existence of special truths that we don't think about in the first place. I can't find any specific examples through my thoughts, but I am sure this is important in some way. After all, what may seem like an unimportant coincidence could be a gateway to truth.\n",

It is a pretty cool truth that I didn't realize before.\n",

        "Unfortunately, the pigeonhole principle only proves that a solution exists which leads me to the philosophical aspect of the pigeonhole principle. Even though I may not think this very important, it has huge ramifications in mathematics. Some problems are hopelessly complex and the idea of finding a solution may seem nearly impossible. Some may think there is no solution at all. With this principle, the existence of a solution can be proven, even though the solution itself hasn't been found.\n",

That may be because I used examples similar to Brother Bessey's in his article.
